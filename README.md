Template for testing roles
==========================

This an Ansible project template that I use with travis to test my roles. The main idea behind this is :

  - Setting up an ansible project
  - Execute my lxd role to deploy a container using ENVIRONMENT variables
  - Execute the role to test on the container

Requirements
------------

  - Ubuntu 14.04
  - Ubuntu 16.04

  The purpose of this project is to be used with travis, as of now it means running on Ubuntu trusty.
